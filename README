Cognition experiment

- I implemented the experiment using psychoPy. Every phase of the experiment is within
a single python script that I have wrote.

- The script is implemented in a generic manner. The user can manually define the following:

- The directory of the experiments pictures
- The desired number of trials in the experiment
- The duration of each trial type in the experiment
- The number of times each of the sounds in experiment will be played.

In order to implement the requested tones, I have built a python script that
generates pure tones with the duration, frequency and volume that can be defined (as magic numbers)
by the user. Notice that I have also submitted that script.

As part of the experiment, I have decided to additonaly program the script in a way that
will enable the user to set the number of trials to be higher than the number of images.
In that case, the images will be shuffled each time all of the images were shown (For instance,
if there are 20 images and trial number is 40, 20 images will be shown in a random order and 
afterwards, the 20 images will be displayed again in a *different* random order). Same goes for the
random order in which the various sounds are played.

Also, as requested, the experiments records (trial times) are exported to an external csv file once
the program finlizes it's run.

Submitted files:
- 440.wav Sound file for the 440 frequency sounds
- 500.wav Sound file for the 500 frequency sounds
- tone_generator.py Script that I have used to generate the sounds
- experiment.py Main script that is used by psychpy for the experiment
- experiment.psyexp The main executable file
